/**
 * preload.ts - Electron preload script
 *
 * Runs before the renderer loads, with access to Node.js APIs.
 * Use contextBridge to safely expose APIs to the renderer.
 *
 * Currently empty - add IPC handlers here when needed for:
 * - File system access
 * - Native OS features
 * - Secure communication between main and renderer
 *
 * @see https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/process-model#preload-scripts
